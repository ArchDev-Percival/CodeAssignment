# Auth0 Cruise0 Proof of Concept

## Purpose:
A front-end single page application in React.js to demonstrate integration of the Auth0 SDK to meet IAM requirements. 

## Key Demonstrations:

### 1. Show how Auth0 can support the Cruise0 app modernization on ReactJS
 * Demonstrate the ease of use and core functionality of the [Auth0 React SDK for Single Page Apps](https://auth0.com/docs/libraries/auth0-react)
  * Configure the `Auth0Provider` so that `useAuth0()` can be used anywhere within its scope.
  * Use `useAuth0()` to access various authentication capabilities provided by the SDK such as:              
    * `loginWithRedirect`
    * `logout`
    * `user`
    * `isLoading`
    * `error`
  * Demonstrate protected routes such as `/profile`

### 2. Show how a new customer can sign up, and how an existing customer can sign in with email/password, and Google
 * Utilize [Auth0 Database Connections](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/database)
 * Utilize [Auth0 Social Identity Providers](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/identity-providers-social), specifically [Connect[ing] Apps to Google](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/social/google)

### 3. Ensure that customers who login with username/password and Google, with the same email address, will be treated as the same user. Also known as Account Linking.
 * Utilize [Auth0 Account Linking](https://auth0.com/docs/users/user-account-linking) specifically the [Account Link Extension](https://auth0.com/docs/extensions/account-link-extension)

### 4. The application should display an error if the customerâ€™s email address is not verified.
 * Through the context provided within the `Auth0Provider` wrapper, use `useAuth0()` to access the authenticated user's profile. 
 * The boolean value of `user.email_verified` tells us if the present authenticated account is verified and displays relevant "core functionality" if so. If the user is not verified, an appropriate message is displayed. 

### 5. Use Auth0 features to customize the profile page so both the photo and country flag are displayed without prompting users to input directly.
 * Utilize pre-existing [rule](https://auth0.com/docs/rules), that is **Add Country To The User Profile** in the Auth0 management dashboard to enrich the user profile to include country information.
 * Create a rule to elevate the data from the secondary profile in the `user` object that is returned by `useAuth0()`.
 * **Learning:** Custom claims need to have a globally unique name, which to Auth0 is a URL. [Source](https://auth0.com/docs/tokens/create-namespaced-custom-claims)
 * The country name is used to obtain a country code which is replaced in `https://lipis.github.io/flag-icon-css/flags/4x3/${code}.svg` to obtain the related country flag. 


### 6. If the photo and country of the customer are known, make sure this information is passed back to the application and shown after the user authenticates.
 * When a user is authenticated, the previously displayed LoginButton is replaced with a menu that displays:
    * the user's photo, if present, or the first letter of their name, if a photo is not available.
    * the country flag is displayed along the route to the profile.
 * This information is also present in the user profile page 
    
## Setting up the App Locally
 * Download the GitHub repository: `git clone https://github.com/DominicPD/CodeAssignment`
 * To change the Auth0 tenant, update `./src/auth0_config.json`
 * Install the dependencies: `npm install`
 * Run the application: `npm run start`
 * The application will run on `http://localhost/3000`
 * Make sure to update the callback URL in the relevant Application in the Auth0 Management dashboard to `http://localhost/3000`.
 
## Deploy the App to Netlify
 * Download the GitHub repository: `git clone https://github.com/DominicPD/CodeAssignment`
 * To change the Auth0 tenant, update `./src/auth0_config.json`
 * Install the dependencies: `npm install`
 * Create a production ready build: `npm run build`
 * Create a new project on Netlify
 * Drag and drop the `build` folder to Netlify which will trigger deployment
 * If you would like to trigger automatic deployments, connect your Netlify project to your fork of `https://github.com/DominicPD/CodeAssignment` on GitHub.
 * Make sure to update the callback URL in the relevant Application in the Auth0 Management dashboard to **the URL generated by the Netlify deployment**.
